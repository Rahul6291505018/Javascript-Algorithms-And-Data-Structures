## What is a debounce function?

Debounce function limits the execution of a function call and waits for a certain amount of time before running it again.

```js
const debounceFunc = (func, delay) => {
   let timer;
    return function(...args) {
       const context = this;
       clearTimeOut(timer);
       timer = setTimeOut(() => {
           func.apply(context, args);
       }, delay)
     }}
```

## What is throttle function?

Throttling is a technique, to limit the execution of an event handler function, even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions. (ex: browser resizing)

```js
const throttleFunc = (func, interval) => {
     let shouldFire = true;
   return function() {
         if (shouldFire) {
             func();
             shouldFire = false;
             setTimeOut(() => {
               shouldFire = true;
              }, interval)
            }
       }
  }
```

* To find the **longest substring without repeating characters**, you can use a **sliding window** approach with two pointers (left and right) to track the current window, and a hash map to store the index of the characters.

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  let seen = new Map();  // Hash map to store the last index of each character
  let maxLength = 0;
  let left = 0;          // Left pointer for the sliding window
  
  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    const currentChar = s[right];
    
    // If the character is already in the map and its index is greater than or equal to left, update left
    if (seen.has(currentChar) && seen.get(currentChar) >= left) {
      left = seen.get(currentChar) + 1;
    }
    
    // Update or add the current character's index in the map
    seen.set(currentChar, right);
    
    // Calculate the maximum length of substring so far
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }
  
  return maxLength;
}
```

### Example Usage:

```javascript
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb"));  // Output: 3 ("abc")
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"));     // Output: 1 ("b")
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"));    // Output: 3 ("wke")
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring(""));          // Output: 0
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sliding Window**: 
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to maintain the current window of characters.
   - As you move `right` through the string, check if the current character is already in the map and its last index is within the window (i.e., greater than or equal to `left`).
   
2. **Updating Window**:
   - If a repeating character is found, move the `left` pointer just after the previous occurrence of that character.
   - Store or update the index of each character in the hash map (`seen`).

3. **Calculate Length**:
   - For each new character, update the maximum length of the substring if the current window is longer.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once when the right pointer moves and once when the left pointer moves).
